# This one weird trick!
# If our top changelog entry looks like this:
#   cyclops (1.0.0-0) unstable; urgency=medium
# And we run with "--local 1" for DISTRO=jammy, then we get this:
#   cyclops (1.0.0-1) jammy; urgency=medium
# Which is precisely what we want.
#dch --distribution "$DISTRO" --local 1 -m "Automated build for $DISTRO"

# But hang on, there's an even simpler technique.
# This will modify the top entry, so that it's target is the given distro.
# And it won't change the version number.
dch --distribution "$DISTRO" -a -m "Automated build for $DISTRO, git revision $(git rev-parse HEAD)"
