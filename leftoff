The back button doesn't work nicely when labelling a recording.
Perhaps the Label control should know what "Cancel"/"Save" should do.
It can either:

1. Pop a route off the stack (if labelling an existing recording)
2. Return to the Editor (if labelling a new recording)

After editing a recording, the Edit Recording view is not properly updated.
Specifically, the "unlabeled"/"alarm" whatever.. labelling button is out of date.
Finally...
Also.. after making a new recording, I think it is missing ontologyID.
the workflow after making a new recording is horrible. If the user saves the record,
we should jump immediately into labelling mode.
