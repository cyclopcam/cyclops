Build full ncnn debug, with examples and tools
#cmake -DNCNN_SIMPLEOCV=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DNCNN_BUILD_TOOLS=ON -DNCNN_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..


pnnx doesn't get included by the regular cmake lists.
OK.. it magically seemed to build successfully, if I just did the regular cmake/make thing from inside the 'pnnx' directory.

Great, looks like YOLOv11 output format (for object detection) is 100% compatible with YOLOv8.

2024-11-12: Getting weird behaviour when using non-square YOLO models (eg 320 x 256).
For example, on driveway test image, I get 4 images coming out.
Square models like 320x320 works fine.
OK!! The answer was simply that imgsz must be imgsz=h,w instead of imgsz=w,h

yolov8
	output shape: w=1680, h=84

yolov11
	output shape: w=1680, h=84
